# Static Analysis

This document details the procedure for performing a static analyses (e.g. Limit, Ultimate, FBO)of aerospace components. Includes TRS, Cases, IMC and other structural components. This document does not cover dynamic analysis, fatigue or crack propagation evaluations.


The main steps to follow are:

1. Prepare inputs to FEM analysis.
   1. Prepare geometry and generate mesh.
   2. Process loads and compare with previous applicable loads.
   3. Define material properties to be used
2. Generate run files for FEM analysis.
   1. Import meshes
   2. Define boundary conditions and constraints.
   3. Define loads.
   4. Define material properties.
   5. Define analysis type and settings.
3. Run FEM analysis.
4. Post-process results.
   1. Extract results from FEM analysis.
   2. Evaluate results against criteria.
5. Generate reports and documentation.

## Loads Processing

If no information about the loads exist, they should be assumed that they are limit loads and therefore be multiplied by a safety factor of 1.5 to obtain the ultimate loads. This is an important step: limit loads have been used for an ultimate analysis in the past because it was assumed that the loads were ultimate.

Paying attention to loads units is critical. Our FEM models uses SI units (N N/m). If loads are provided in other units, they must always be converted to N and Nm for forces and moments respectively. The conversion factor is 1 klb = 4448.22 N and 1 klb-ft = 1.35582 Nm.

It is standard practice to always check new loads and compare it with a pre-existing set of previous applicable loads delivered by the customer. If they exceed, we need to perform a new analysis. But if none of the loads exceed and the geometry and all other inputs are the same, a complete analysis is not needed, simply the loads comparison results and an statement instead. 

If the new loads exceed in any direction, then the envelope of old and new files need to be performed and that will be the collection of load cases that will be evaluated in the FEM analysis. If no loads exceed, no new analysis is needed and the final report shall contain the load comparison results and a statement indicating that no further analysis is needed.

The loads needs to be translated from the customer format to an ANSYS format readable by ANSYS. Each load case is stored in an individual file and then read directly, one by one, into ANSYS in a load-solve-release loop iteration.

The complete load set shall be reduced by applying a envelope operation, typically done during the loads processing activities. This operation dowselects the load cases as it remove those that are not max or min in any force or moment direction. It is best to create only the ansys load files corresponding to the envelope of the load set, as this will reduce the number of load cases to be evaluated in the FEM analysis.

Care shall be taken to ensure that the coordinates provided by the customer match the coordinates used in the FEM model. If they do not match, the loads must be transformed to the FEM model coordinates.
